EMDR resources

A working lightbar app that is platform agnostic and simple to use. The
bilateral stimulation page is available here:
[emdr.mfriedrich.win](https://emdr.mfriedrich.win).

## Usage

*Note: the terms* *websites, application, app, and software* *will be used interchangeably here to describe this EMDR light bar resource.* This app will work on any Internet enabled device using any modern web browser. The clinician can use it by going to the URL [https://emdr.mfriedrich.win](https://emdr.mfriedrich.win/) and then sharing their screen with their client. The new version does not work with Internet Explorer, the old version can still be found here [https://emdr.mfriedrich.win/old](https://emdr.mfriedrich.win/old)). Theoretically, any video-conferencing software will work although, the following have been tested:

-   Zoom

-   Attend Anywhere

-   Skype

It should be noted that older IOS devices, such as iPads, do not always support screen share facility. So, if the clinician or the client are using one of these devices with the app, it may not work.

### User Interface

It is useful to note that you can reset the application by simply refreshing the page. To do this you can normally press <kbd>F5</kbd>, <kbd>Ctrl+R</kbd> (Windows) or <kbd>CMD+R</kbd> (MacOS), there is normally a button to do this as well.

At the start of the session, you can share the window in which you have this app open with your client. How this is done depends on the video-conferencing software that you are using. Some examples are found below. 

The settings in the grey box can be changed by clicking on them and they will automatically update.

#### Settings

To start the ball click ![outline_play_arrow_black_24dp](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaxAFriedrich/EMDR/main/readmeImgs/outline_play_arrow_black_24dp.png), to stop the ball click ![outline_stop_black_24dp](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaxAFriedrich/EMDR/main/readmeImgs/outline_stop_black_24dp.png). You can hide the settings box by clicking ![outline_visibility_off_black_24dp](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaxAFriedrich/EMDR/main/readmeImgs/outline_visibility_off_black_24dp.png) and  ![outline_visibility_black_24dp](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaxAFriedrich/EMDR/main/readmeImgs/outline_visibility_black_24dp.png) to show them again.


##### Speed
Speed changes the speed at which the ball moves across the screen, typical values range between 0.5 and 15. 

##### Sets
Sets changes the number of times the ball moves before it stops. This value can be set to any integer. Setting it to 1 would mean that the ball would move from the starting position to the opposite side of the screen and back once. 

##### Timer
Timer allows time to be changed to any required length in seconds. 

##### Colour
Colour changes the colour of the ball. By clicking one of the coloured dots, the ball will change accordingly. If you want a custom colour, click on the square which opens a colour picker, which by default is black. You can then move the sliders to a different colour and when you click off the colour picker, the colour will change.

##### Background
Background changes the colour of the background. By clicking one of the coloured dots, the ball will change accordingly. If you want a custom colour, click on the square which opens a colour picker, which by default is black. You can then move the sliders to a different colour and when you click off the colour picker, the colour will change.

##### Size
Size changes the size of the ball. Click on one of the different sized dots to change the size of the ball.

##### Direction
Direction changes the vector on which the ball moves.

- ![outline_west_black_24dp](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaxAFriedrich/EMDR/main/readmeImgs/outline_west_black_24dp.png) sets the ball to move horizontally.

- ![outline_south_east_black_24dp](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaxAFriedrich/EMDR/main/readmeImgs/outline_south_east_black_24dp.png) sets the ball to move from the top left to bottom right.

- ![outline_south_west_black_24dp](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaxAFriedrich/EMDR/main/readmeImgs/outline_south_west_black_24dp.png) sets the ball to move from the top right to bottom left.

##### Sound

Sound lets you select a type of soundwave (sawtooth, sinewave, triangle or square) and the frequency for that soundwave.  To enable it, click the ![outline_volume_up_black_24dp](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaxAFriedrich/EMDR/main/readmeImgs/outline_volume_up_black_24dp.png), and to disable it click ![outline_volume_off_black_24dp](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaxAFriedrich/EMDR/main/readmeImgs/outline_volume_off_black_24dp.png).  Sound will only play through the left channel when the ball hits the left endpoint and the right channel when the ball hits the right endpoint.

**Note:** this feature may not work on some devices and in some web browsers, although it seems to work best in Chrome-based browsers.  If it is not working, it can be helpful to click ![outline_volume_up_black_24dp](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaxAFriedrich/EMDR/main/readmeImgs/outline_volume_up_black_24dp.png)/![outline_volume_off_black_24dp](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaxAFriedrich/EMDR/main/readmeImgs/outline_volume_off_black_24dp.png) a few times.




##### Infinity/Manual button

*PLEASE NOTE there is a new Infinity* setting in the Sets and Timer functions, which means that when both Sets and Timer are in the Infinity mode, the ball will keep moving at the speed you chose until you press the start/press button. You can select the infinity mode for each setting by clicking ![outline_all_inclusive_black_24dp](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaxAFriedrich/EMDR/main/readmeImgs/outline_all_inclusive_black_24dp.png), and to edit the setting manually you can click ![outline_edit_black_24dp](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaxAFriedrich/EMDR/main/readmeImgs/outline_edit_black_24dp.png).

### Using Screen Share

Open the app in a web browser, either the same one in a new window or in a different web browser to the main one that you are using for your video-conferencing software. You can chose any of the following browsers: Microsoft Edge, Chrome, Firefox and Apple Safari. 

1.  Click the screen share button in the video-conferencing software.

2.  A smaller window, or pop-up will then open.

3.  Click the button to share a specific window. It is generally best not to
    share your entire screen.

4.  Then select the browser window in which the application is located.

5.  Then click the okay button in the pop-up.

6.  The client should now be able to see the software.

To make sure that you can see the client’s face, there are 2 options depending on the software that you are using.

Firstly, in video-conferencing software such as Skype, when you minimise Skype, a small window with the client’s face will appear.

Secondly, in other applications, such as Attend Anywhere, you may have to have a smaller window with the application in it and overlay it on top of the video-conferencing software.
